Open Source Pandemic Virus Protection Systems

Our goal is to develop open source pandemic virus protection technology that will significantly improve the safety of healthcare workers on the front lines of COVID-19.

To achieve this we are working to isignificantly reduce the manufacturing and operating cost of a PAPR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_air-purifying_respirator) while maintaining HEPA filter efficiency (99.97% for 3um particles) and make sure the design can be easily mass produced anywhere in the world using standard commercial manufacturing machinery and automation.
